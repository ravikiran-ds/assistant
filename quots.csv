The only time family becomes null is when those ties in the heart are cut. If you cut those ties, those people are not your family. If you make those ties, those people are your family. And if you hate those ties, those people will still be your family because whatever you hate will always be with you.  - C. JoyBell C.	"

"livid, adj.  Fuck You for cheating on me. Fuck you for reducing it to the word cheating. As if this were a card game, and you sneaked a look at my hand. Who came up with the term cheating, anyway? A cheater, I imagine. Someone who thought liar was too harsh. Someone who thought devastator was too emotional. The same person who thought, oops, he™d gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar. Fuck you. This isn™t about slipping yourself an extra twenty dollars of Monopoly money. These are our lives. You went and broke our lives. You are so much worse than a cheater. You killed something. And you killed it when its back was turned.  - David Levithan, The Lover's Dictionary	"

I destroy them.  - Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game	"

"Now there is a final reason I think that Jesus says, ""Love your enemies."" It is this: that love has within it a redemptive power. And there is a power there that eventually transforms individuals. Just keep being friendly to that person. Just keep loving them, and they can™t stand it too long. Oh, they react in many ways in the beginning. They react with guilt feelings, and sometimes they™ll hate you a little more at that transition period, but just keep loving them. And by the power of your love they will break down under the load. That™s love, you see. It is redemptive, and this is why Jesus says love. There™s something about love that builds up and is creative. There is something about hate that tears down and is destructive. So love your enemies. (from ""Loving Your Enemies"")  - Martin Luther King Jr., A Knock at Midnight: Inspiration from the Great Sermons of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.	"

"Anger is like flowing water; there's nothing wrong with it as long as you let it flow. Hate is like stagnant water; anger that you denied yourself the freedom to feel, the freedom to flow; water that you gathered in one place and left to forget. Stagnant water becomes dirty, stinky, disease-ridden, poisonous, deadly; that is your hate. On flowing water travels little paper boats; paper boats of forgiveness. Allow yourself to feel anger, allow your waters to flow, along with all the paper boats of forgiveness. Be human.  - C. JoyBell C.	"
"Everything with me is either worship and passion or pity and understanding. I hate rarely, though when I hate, I hate murderously. For example now, I hate the bank and everything connected with it.

But I am much more preoccupied with loving.  - AnaÃ¯s Nin, Henry and June: From ""A Journal of Love"": The Unexpurgated Diary of AnaÃ¯s Nin, 1931-1932	"
